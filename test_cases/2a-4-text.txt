Backtracking is a systematic way to run through all the possible configurations of a search space. These configurations may represent all possible arrangements of objects i.e. permutations or all possible ways of building a collection of them i.e. subsets. Other common situations demand enumerating all spanning trees of a graph, all paths between two vertices, or all possible ways to partition vertices into color classes.
